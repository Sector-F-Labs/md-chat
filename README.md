## Configuration

MD-Chat uses a TOML config file for settings such as your OpenAI API key and API URL. **Environment variables are no longer required.**

### Config File Location
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/MD-Chat/config.toml`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/MD-Chat/config.toml`

The config file is created automatically on first run if it does not exist.

### Example `config.toml`
```toml
openai_api_key = "sk-...yourkey..."
api_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
```
- If `openai_api_key` is missing or empty, requests will fail unless the API does not require a key.
- You can edit this file to change your API key or use a different API URL.

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build the application
cargo build --release

# Run the application
cargo run --release
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Type your message in the input box
